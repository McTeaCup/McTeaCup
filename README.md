## Hi I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹ ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=McTeaCup&style=for-the-badge)
I'm a DevOps Engineer who loves to optimize and automate development for everyone. Previously I studied game development where I focused more on tools and found interest in backend engineering, soon enough I found out about DevOps and realized that it felt more like home. And from that point forward I've kept going.
